> # OWTF is taking part in the Google Summer of Code 2024 ! If you'd like to participate then see the [OWASP Google Summer of Code 2024 Ideas page](https://owasp.org/www-community/initiatives/gsoc/gsoc2024ideas#owasp-owtf)!

OWTF aims to make pen testing:

* Aligned with OWASP Testing Guide + PTES + NIST
* More efficient
* More comprehensive
* More creative and fun (minimise un-creative work)

so that pentesters will have more time to

* See the big picture and think out of the box
* More efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities
* Have time to investigate complex vulnerabilities like business logic/architectural flaws or virtual hosting sessions
* Perform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas
* Demonstrate true impact despite the short timeframes we are typically given to test.

> ### **The latest version of OWASP OWTF is [OWTF v2.5.0](https://github.com/owtf/owtf/releases/tag/v2.5.0).**

OWTF attempts to solve the "penetration testers are never given enough time to test properly" problem, or in other words, OWTF = Test/Exploit ASAP, with this in mind, as of right now, the priorities are:

- To improve security testing efficiency (i.e. test more in less time)
- To improve security testing coverage (i.e. test more)
- Gradually integrate the best tools
- Unite the best tools and make them work together with the security tester
- Remove or Reduce the need to babysit security tools during security assessments
- Be a respository of PoC resource links to assist exploitation of vulnerabilities in order to illustrate risk to businesses.
- Help penetration testers save time on report writing
